Pneumonia Detection and Classification

📌 Overview

This project focuses on detecting and classifying pneumonia from chest X-ray images using deep learning. The model classifies images into Normal and Pneumonia categories to assist in early detection and diagnosis.

🚀 Features

Deep Learning Model: Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image classification.

Dataset: Utilizes labeled chest X-ray images.

Preprocessing: Image augmentation and normalization for better model performance.

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and Confusion Matrix.

User Interface: (Optional) Web or GUI for easy image upload and classification.

📂 Dataset

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle’s Chest X-ray Dataset.

Contains two classes: Normal and Pneumonia.

Images are resized and normalized before training.

🔧 Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/pneumonia-detection.git
cd pneumonia-detection

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

📊 Model Training

To train the model, run:

python train.py

Training logs and performance metrics will be saved.

🖼️ Running Inference

To classify a new chest X-ray image:

python predict.py --image path/to/image.jpg

The model will output whether the image is Normal or Pneumonia.

📈 Performance Metrics

The model is evaluated using:

Accuracy

Precision & Recall

Confusion Matrix
